# CVFisher

This repo is to co-ordinate running of Fisher codes for the 21-cm CV group.
The structure is as follows:

## Assumptions

### Cosmology

Three files in directory `assumptions`:

 * `background_zlow.dat`: cosmo and astro parameters for z=0..6
 * `background_zhigh.dat`: cosmo as astro parameters for z=30-50
 * `pk0.dat`: linear power spectrum as z=0 -- to be assumed to just scale with growth factor^2

The assumed cosmology was Planck15 + BAO *with massless* neutrinos. The motivation here is that perhaps some codes do have
an internal Friedman equation and don't want to properly deal with neutrino distribution function.

Columns in `background_*.dat` files are:
`z distance(z)[Mpc] growth(z)[normalised at z=0] growth_rate Tspin(z) [mK]  b(z) N(z) [Mpc^3]`

For spin temperature, I took:
 * Low-z: Tzu-Ching et al, arXiv:0709.3672 formula
 * High-z: Model by Pritchard & Loeb, arXiv:1005.4057, as supplied to me by ACLiu
 
For bias, shot-noise:
 * Low-z: Castorina & Villaescusa-Navarro, arXiv:/1609.05157
 * High-z: bias=1, Pn=0

Finally, the `assumptions/src/make_cosmo.py` is a script used to generate the above. In needs `classy` module that
interfaces CLASS code to python (imperfectly).

Cosmology used for the above is defined as LCDM(don't forget to update this is `make_cosmo` changes!!) with:
```
   'A_s': 2.234e-9,
   'n_s': 0.96708,
   'h': 0.67610,
   'omega_b': 0.022319,
   'omega_cdm': 0.11910,
   'tau_reio': 0.0865,
```


### Sky background

For the sake of concreteness, let's assume this fitting formula

Tsky = 2000K * (f/100MHz)^(-2.4) + 2.7K

This is consistent with typical sky for NRAO plot:

## Experiment

The cosmic fisher S2 experiment is given by

### Experiment A:

 * 256x256 regular grid of parabollic dishes
 * D=6
 * f_sky=0.5
 * Treceiver=50K
 * zrange1: 2-6, zrange2: 30-50
 * integration time: 5 years at 100% efficiency
